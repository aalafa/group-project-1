# Housing Market Trends in Relation to the Average Family Income

This project analyzes housing market trends in relation to the average family income, focusing on the challenges faced by young Americans aged 18 to 25. The analysis is based on data sourced from censusdata.gov and is presented through code implementation, data visualization, and a slide deck.

## Motivation:

Our motivation for this project is to shed light on the economic hardships faced by young Americans, particularly those in the 18 to 25 age group. With economic disparities and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the purchasing power of this segment has weakened, making it challenging to afford homes and build personal wealth. We believe it's crucial to raise awareness about these issues and their implications. In doing so, we may be able to curtail the impact of economic disparities and allow for the segment to begin to prosper.

## Insights:

Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, the housing market has experienced significant shifts. The average home price in the United States has surged, highlighting the struggles faced by young potential homebuyers. The income gap between this demographic and the cost of homes indicates a growing trend of housing market growth compared to stagnant income growth.

## Data Visualizations:

We used Pandas to process the datasets obtained from censusdata.gov. Our team members, Amanda and Rocio, gathered and implemented the data into code, which was then translated into clear line graph visualizations. Adolfo transformed the datasets and visuals into a simplified slide deck for our presentation.

## Findings:

Our analysis revealed that household incomes vary from state to state. Despite this variation, the challenge of purchasing a home at the age of 25 remains a significant hurdle across the country. The gap between income and home prices underscores the difficulty young Americans face in entering the housing market and building wealth.

## Conclusion:

This project aims to raise awareness about the economic disparities young Americans encounter in the housing market. By presenting concrete data and insights, we hope to contribute to the ongoing dialogue about economic challenges faced by the 18 to 25 age group.
